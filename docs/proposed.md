This is an excellent domain for a proof of concept. The Sudoku puzzle is a perfect example of a "formal domain" with explicit, non-ambiguous rules, which is the ideal use case for an RI-TRM.

Your hypothesis is a direct test of the paper's central claims. Here is a practical design for your proof of concept, mapping the RI-TRM architecture directly to the Sudoku problem.

## Proof of Concept Design: RI-TRM for Sudoku

Your goal is to compare a baseline TRM (which must *learn* the rules of Sudoku from scratch) against your RI-TRM (which is *given* the rules).

### Component 1: The Baseline Model (Standard TRM)

First, define your control group. This model reflects the "traditional approach" the paper argues against.

  * **Architecture:** A small 7M parameter sequence-to-sequence model (like a small Transformer).
  * **Input:** A string representing the unsolved puzzle (e.g., `"530070000600195000098000060..."`).
  * **Output:** A string representing the solved puzzle (e.g., `"534678912672195348198342567..."`).
  * **Training:** You must train this model on a large dataset of (unsolved\_puzzle, solved\_puzzle) pairs. The network's 7M parameters are forced to encode both the *rules* of Sudoku and the *strategy* for solving it.

### Component 2: The RI-TRM Implementation

This model is built according to the paper's "Three-Layer Knowledge Architecture". The neural network's job is no longer to *store rules*, but to *learn decision-making*.

#### Layer 2: Structural Rule Graph ($K_R$) (The "Rule-Initialized" Verifier)

This is the "Rule-Initialized" part. Instead of a graph, you'll implement this as a simple verification function `V(y, R)`.

  * **Formal Rules $R$:**
    1.  **Row Rule:** Each digit 1-9 must appear exactly once per row.
    2.  **Column Rule:** Each digit 1-9 must appear exactly once per column.
    3.  **Box Rule:** Each digit 1-9 must appear exactly once per 3x3 sub-grid.
  * **Verification Function `V(grid)`:**
      * **Input:** A 9x9 grid `y`.
      * **Output:** A set of `violations`.
      * **Example `violations`:**
          * `{"ROW_CONFLICT_R1_D5"}` (Row 1 has two '5's)
          * `{"COL_CONFLICT_C7_D9"}` (Col 7 has two '9's)
          * `{"BOX_CONFLICT_B3_D2"}` (Box 3 has two '2's)
          * `{"EMPTY_CELL_R1C3"}` (Cell (1,3) is empty)

This verifier provides **zero-shot verification competence**. From initialization, your model *knows* what a valid Sudoku solution is without any training.

#### Layer 3: Path Memory Graph ($K_P$) (The "Hebbian Learner")

This is your Hebbian path strengthening mechanism. It will be a dictionary that stores learned patterns.

  * **Definition:** `K_P = {(s_i, a_j, s_k, w)}`.
  * **Mapping to Sudoku:**
      * **State `s_i`:** The set of `violations` from your verifier (e.g., `frozenset({"ROW_CONFLICT_R1_D5", "EMPTY_CELL_R1C3"})`).
      * **Action `a_j`:** The transformation applied. For Sudoku, this is placing a digit: `("PLACE", row, col, digit)`.
      * **Resulting State `s_k`:** The *new* set of `violations` after applying `a_j`.
      * **Weight `w`:** The path's success rate.
  * **Hebbian Update (Sec 4.1):**
      * You will call `K_P.update(path, success)`.
      * `success` is defined as `len(new_violations) < len(old_violations)`.
      * If `success == 1`, you apply **long-term potentiation** (increase `w`).
      * If `success == 0`, you apply **long-term depression** (decrease `w`).

#### The Tiny Network ($f_N$) (The "Decision-Maker")

This is the 7M parameter neural network. Its role is *not* to solve the puzzle, but to **choose the next action (fix)**.

  * **Input:**
    1.  The current grid `y`.
    2.  The current `violations` from $K_R$.
    3.  `candidate_paths` from $K_P$ (e.g., "For this error, path memory suggests 'PLACE, 1, 3, 5' with 92% confidence").
  * **Output:** An action `a_j = ("PLACE", row, col, digit)`. This is a classification problem over `9*9*9 = 729` possible moves.
  * **Role:** The network learns a *policy* for solving the puzzle. It learns to answer: "Given the current board state and these conflicts, and given what path memory suggests, what is the *best* cell to fill next?".

#### The Recursive Refinement Algorithm (The "Solver Loop")

This is Algorithm 1 from the paper, adapted for Sudoku.

1.  Start with the initial puzzle `y`.
2.  **Loop** for `N_sup` iterations (e.g., 81 steps, one per empty cell):
3.  `violations = K_R.verify(y)`.
4.  If `violations` is empty: **return `y` (Success\!)**.
5.  `candidate_paths = K_P.query(violations)`.
6.  Use **$\epsilon$-greedy selection** (Sec 4.2):
      * With probability $\epsilon$, pick a random action `a_j` (exploration).
      * With probability $1-\epsilon$, ask the network for the best action: `a_j = f_N(y, violations, candidate_paths)` (exploitation).
7.  Apply the action: `y_new = apply_action(y, a_j)`.
8.  Get new violations: `violations_new = K_R.verify(y_new)`.
9.  Calculate success: `success = len(violations_new) < len(violations)`.
10. **Update Path Memory:** `K_P.update((violations, a_j, violations_new), success)`.
11. Set `y = y_new` and continue loop.
12. **Return `y` (Failure if not solved)**.

## Training and Evaluation

This is how you'll follow the paper's "Task-Based Training" paradigm and prove your hypothesis.

  * **Training:**
      * **Baseline TRM:** Needs 100,000+ (puzzle, solution) pairs to learn the rules.
      * **RI-TRM:** You train it on *tasks*. Give it 1,000 puzzles. For each puzzle, the solver loop (Algorithm 1) runs.
          * The **neural network ($f_N$)** is trained via backpropagation. Its loss function (`L_total`) is based on whether the final puzzle was solved (`L_test`). It learns to pick actions that lead to a `success=1` state.
          * The **path memory ($K_P$)** learns *simultaneously* via Hebbian updates.
  * **Hypothesis Verification:**
    1.  **Metric 1: Accuracy (pass@1):** Give both models 1,000 unseen "hard" puzzles. The RI-TRM should have a much higher success rate, closer to the paper's "expert-level performance".
    2.  **Metric 2: Sample Efficiency:** This is key. Plot accuracy vs. number of training puzzles (100, 500, 1,000). Your RI-TRM should achieve high accuracy with only 1,000 tasks, while the baseline TRM will still be struggling, proving the 1000x training efficiency claim.
    3.  **Metric 3: Interpretability:** For any puzzle, your RI-TRM can output a human-readable "reasoning trace". The baseline TRM is a black box.

### Example RI-TRM Reasoning Trace

This is what your model's output could look like, matching Section 4.3 of the paper:

```
Step 1: State = {"EMPTY_CELL_R1C3", "EMPTY_CELL_R1C4", ...}
        Network Action: ("PLACE", 1, 3, 4)
        Result: State = {"ROW_CONFLICT_R1_D4", "EMPTY_CELL_R1C4", ...}
        Hebbian Update: K_P.update(..., success=0) [Weight decayed]

Step 2: State = {"ROW_CONFLICT_R1_D4", "EMPTY_CELL_R1C4", ...}
        Query K_P: Found 12 paths for "ROW_CONFLICT_R1_D4"
        Candidate: (Change (1,3) to '8', weight=0.91)
        Network Action (guided by K_P): ("PLACE", 1, 3, 8)
        Result: State = {"EMPTY_CELL_R1C4", ...}
        Hebbian Update: K_P.update(..., success=1) [Weight strengthened]

Step 3: State = {"EMPTY_CELL_R1C4", ...}
        ...
```

By following this design, you directly implement the paper's core ideas: separating rules ($K_R$) from learned patterns ($K_P$), using a small network ($f_N$) for decision-making, and training on tasks, not tokens.
